#Worldcade

Making your downtime into uptime.

Millions of hours are spent playing computer games every day.
With a small contribution of processing power, those could become millions of
hours spent improving our world.

Worldcade is a platform for videogames where your computer solves problems while
you relax. Each solution is a critical contribution, helping research faculties
that lack computing power save minutes, hours, days, or even weeks of time spent
crunching data.

By engaging users through browser-delivered entertainment, 
the service aims to make this process, called distributed computing, 
both more accessible and more engaging to people, allowing them to relax while
contributing to life-changing research.
